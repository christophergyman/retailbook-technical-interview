# AI Conversation Transcript

## Session 1 — Project Scaffolding

**Prompt**: Implement Phase 0 scaffolding — set up Turborepo monorepo with workspace packages, Next.js app, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Vitest, and Claude Code agent skills.

**Response summary**: AI generated the full monorepo structure including root configs (turbo.json, tsconfig.base.json, eslint flat config, prettier), 4 workspace packages (shared, logger, db, api), scaffolded Next.js via create-next-app, set up Husky pre-commit hooks, and installed agent skills.

**What I did with it**: Accepted as-is after verifying all configs were correct and build/lint/typecheck passed.
